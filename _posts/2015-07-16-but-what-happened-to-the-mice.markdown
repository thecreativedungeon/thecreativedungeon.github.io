<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>llie Cage strolled down the subway train, as if searching for a place to rest. Clad in a black leather jacket and simple black pants, with hair dyed pale blond to hide the oncoming assault of age, she moved cautiously, feet ridden by arthritis and hurting like a bitch.</p>

Twenty years ago she would have looked gorgeous, with her preying green eyes and reddish curls. Back then she was slithering through the world like a cobra, in her 1964 convertible diecast Mustang. Now, she was sixty-three and crawling through the throng like a lazy python after swallowing a stuffed goat.

Pissed, she stopped and grabbed the handrail with the certainty of a slaughterhouse dweller, holding a calf's head into place for a halving swing. In their free time, which now they had aplenty, her hands prepared lemonade for her grandchildren with the same care her butcher's skills got rid of the bodies, decades ago. But her little people, that's what she called her grandchildren, had no idea of this minor detail. In the following day she would be taking them to take the leap.

A mangy man shuffled towards her in the subway, one hand clutching at his shirt and the other one drawn out: the beggars' greeting of choice when they approached those living in fortune's favor. That is, those whose bellies didn't roar with merciless hunger and minds didn't turn in on themselves.

She rummaged through her left pocket, while in her right one she took hold of her clasp-knife. She found some change amid the Vicodin foils, her best friends, and gave it to the beggar. The man thanked an inaudible 'thanks' and took a seat, a few feet away.

Ellie glanced at the beggar the way you would at a patient in terminal stage. He was young, judging by his features, no more than thirty years old. He would never get to know how it’s like after that age.

'Central Park North,' announced a cheery voice from the rusty speaker. In a few seconds the train stopped and she stepped on the platform.

Now the stairs, she thought, angry at the pain kicking in, ever so often now. She ripped open a Vicodin, emptied her pocket of empty foils in the garbage bag and sat down on the first stair, waiting for the pain to diminish. She was supposed to meet Louis at the park exit.

He was probably already waiting for her, but he never minded. After all, she had been his bodyguard until the arthritis kicked in. It was about time the roles switched.

A few moments later, she felt herself a little lighter and the pain receded a bit. She stood up and started climbing.

'Hey, stranger. Waiting for someone?' Ellie said out loud, a few minutes later, emerging slowly from the deserted subway station.

Louis was reading a book on his Kindle, an old piece of technology which he stubbornly refused to throw away as garbage when Ellie suggested him to use his retina reader instead. He turned and faced her, a big warm smile changing his concentrated face. He put his Kindle in his coat pocket and hurried to help her.

'I was, but now you're here, so I guess we can work something out. Especially since you don’t have that walking stick of yours,' he scolded her, with a sly wink.

‘Well, since you put it that way, how can a lady say no?’

‘Do you see any ladies around here?’

They both laughed and Louis helped her to the car.

As Louis opened the door for her, a thunderous ‘Surprise!’ welcomed them. Jack and Carrie jumped in the back of the car, happy to see their grandmother.

‘I couldn’t get away without taking them along,’ Louis said. ‘At least they had fun, while we were at the center.’

‘Yeah, Ellie, we did,’ both kids yelled their approval.

‘Louis showed us the first Ring Pair. I wanted him to show me how he’s done the first leap, but he didn’t wanna!’ Jack added, morosely, crossing his arms.

‘Yeah, all he did was let us put some masks on,’ Carrie followed in suite.

‘Masks?’ Ellie looked surprised.

‘Breathing masks, honey,’ Louis explained to his wife.

‘Are those things safe? After all those years...’ Ellie asked her husband quite upset.

‘Chill out, honey, they’re polished every week with sanitizer. They’re alright.’

‘What were those stupid masks for?’ Jack asked, still disgruntled for not seeing the Rings come to life.

‘They were used for taking the leaps, sweetie,’ Ellie calmed him down. ‘You’ll see tomorrow. Besides, those rings are a pile of rusty metal, anyway. Wait ‘til you see the ones they’re using now,’ Ellie cheered him up.

Jack didn’t seem very much impressed, as he kept his arms crossed, breathing like a threatening rhino. He almost looked like one, too, which made Ellie giggle.

Louis started the engine of his Vanquish. Like reading on his Kindle, driving was one of the pleasures Louis indulged himself with. Though modified to run on batteries, the old five hundred horse power beast was still able to face any four-wheeled contender. The car cruised off.

'What did they say?' Ellie asked, after a short while.

'In two weeks' time,' Louis answered, offering her a tired look.

'Two weeks? Christ...' Ellie's earlier smile was shattered by this statement. 'How much will it take until it's critical?'

'Twenty-seven days, to be more precise,’ Louis said, after a small pause. ‘Until then, we'll all have to take the leap.'

They drove like that for a half an hour, silently thinking about what Earth offered and took away from them. Not being a couple of modern Noahs, helping with making real whatever sliver of hope humanity had, was one thing they would’ve preferred.

Ellie thought about what it would've been like for her and Louis to be your average everyday couple, retiring in old age, raising their grandchildren and making lemonade. Well, at least the lemonade part worked out fine, thanks to food cloning.

Cloning had been a part of their lives since before they were born. That started in 2025, when food had reached an all-time scarcity. After that big hump, the whole world seemed to have escalated a stairway to heaven. Up until 2075 when the greenhouse effect tolled its bells.

'The marriage between human arrogance and utopic hope,' as Ellie's husband proclaimed in their kitchen that night, after the government all but begged him to hasten his research for the leap.

It seemed that humankind started to hiccup in terms of decades, until it choked on its own, with no outside help.

‘Ellie,’ Carrie said, snapping her grandmother awake from her thoughts, ‘will dad be waiting us on the other side, tomorrow?’

Ellie reconstructed her face into a perfect grandmotherly smile before turning around and answering Carrie, not wanting to let the little one get a hint of her troubles.

‘Of course he will, sweetie!’

‘Carrie’s just scared,’ Jack added, sticking his tongue out at his sister.

‘Am not,’ Carrie protested.

‘You are, scaredy cat!’ Jack said back, and then to Ellie: ‘When she heard Louis telling us we’ll be leaping tomorrow, she was this close to crying!’

‘Jack,’ Louis interrupted the kids’ argument, ‘there’s no shame for you little sister to be scared. I know I was scared when I took the first leap.’

‘No way!’ said Jack, dismayed.

‘Way!’ Louis countered. ‘It happened after a very long effort, time and danger, for both your grandmother and I. When it finally got through all the tests, I couldn’t believe it was actually working! I always feared it would collapse at one point or another.’

‘Louis,’ Ellie intervened, not wanting to frighten Carrie.

‘What? Nothing bad ever happened. Well, not because of the machines, anyway!’ Louis defended himself.

‘How did it happen, Louis?’ asked Carrie, trying to hide that her brother had been actually right. In fact, if Carrie knew that her family was one of the most important ones in the world, probably even more important than the president’s, she would've been more relieved.

Her grandfather, Louis Cage, invented the Leap, the means to transport anything, anywhere, from a box of candy to a shuttle fully loaded with people on Kepler. It so happened that that’s where they were going, all four of them, the following day. Jack and Carrie would go to their new home, escorted by their grandparents, while Ellie and Louis would be returning on Earth, to oversee the final migration.

Kepler, Earth’s twin, was discovered back in 2014. Twin was a more benevolent word, given that Earth, which housed the human kind for so long, ended up so wrong. It took almost thirty years to come up with the warp technology. A devoted fan of the Star Trek lore, Andrew Cage, Louis' father, made possible for the spaceships to break the barrier of light-speed and left it as a legacy to his son. Fifty years later, somebody had to pick up where Cage Sr. left off and come up with a viable solution to reach deep space. That’s where Ellie and Louis Cage came in.

Ellie had been a born athlete. When she was seventeen and first year in college, the government immediately took an interest in her. Her sophomore already found her juggling with studying and training to become an agent.

She had no clue that Louis, the dandy geek who invited her on a date on a Virgin Galactic shuttle to take a cruise around the globe, was also courted by the same guys. The men in black saw this affair between two of its recruits as a good omen, so they encouraged their relationship.

Soon after that first date, she started to see beyond Louis’ façade of scientific smugness. Louis, as it turned out, had noble intentions for the future of humankind. She eventually fell for that mix of cocky brilliance and goodhearted individual that was Louis and at the end of the college, they got married. Kind of peculiar, considering that by that time marriages had been reduced to about one in every ten couples.

Soon after what had been an old fashioned marriage ceremony, stapled with a private wedding party, the Cage couple began their excursions into the murky waters of evil interests for the Leap technology. As it always happens to those daring to dream big and good towards their fellow humankind.

Both Ellie and Louis were protected by the government, but never did a month pass without an attempt from some external third party. Either to bribe them or to kill them. By the end of the tenth year of their marriage the monthly occurrences became weekly and after another five years Louis had to opt either for plastic surgery or for living inside a basement of gargantuan proportions, where he would continue his research, three hundred feet under the remote town of Brightwood, California.

'Well,' Louis started, 'it took quite a long time 'til I got it working on the scale it does now. Precisely, it took me almost eight years to get the first prototype right, without failing after ten or twenty minutes of running.'

Louis had been working for almost one week straight, when the first leap in history took place, if he didn't count the random naps he took out of necessity for his brain to get some rest.

He wanted to zoom in on some calculations he'd scribbled on the giant projected blackboard in his lab, when he accidentally brushed against the switch of the first Ring. Not knowing he'd turned it on, he rushed to grab the tablet controlling the projected blackboard, standing on the other side of the Ring.

He let out a horrified scream. His arm disappeared into nothingness, when he reached out under the upper arch of the Ring. He instantly pulled it back. A few moments later, when his wits returned to him and found a calmer Louis, he ran at the other side of the experiment perimeter and turned on the second Ring.

A suite of tests followed. One by one, his lab keys, his smartwatch and a pencil were thrown through the first Ring, landing almost instantaneously on the other side, through the second Ring.

First he threw the keys. His heart was already beating in his neck, but when he heard the loud thump they produced on the farthest side of the perimeter, a feint-like sensation got a hold of him, a lightheartedness you only experience the first time you kiss your crush after thinking about her for so long under the blanket. He tested them, one by one. The doors recognized their keys and so he moved on.

In went the smartwatch. After it had been teleported, Louis picked it up and tested it. There had been no time loss nor addition to the device. Also, the calculations were the same: one plus one equaled two, square-root of nine was still three and so on. He then took a selfie and saw, disappointed, that the camera wasn't anymore generous with his face than it'd been for the past thirty years. 'Not ugly, but still no Brad Pitt,' he thought, remembering the movies his parents watched.

Lastly, he took the pencil test. He got the robotic skeleton, on which the second Ring was raised, to come close to the first Ring at about an arm's length. He pushed the pencil and as it went through, he saw it emerging on the other side. Halfway, he could see the lead and the surrounding wooden frame as if it'd been cut clean.

As he was telling his tale, Louis glanced at Jack and Carrie in the rearview mirror and couldn't help a smile from blossoming on his face. The two kids were ravenous for every word.

'After realizing what just happened,' he carried on, taking a curve in his tamed Vanquish, 'I thought this is what Bell or Edison must have felt like.'

'Who're they?' Jack asked.

The Cage couple exchanged a look of grandfatherly wisdom.

'Thanks to them,' Louis said, 'you can use your smartwatches for just about anything. Calling long distances, seeing your favorite movies projected on your walls...'

Not totally understanding the roles which the said gentlemen had, but which, nonetheless, were recorded in the history databases worldwide, the kids were urging their grandpa to carry on with the story.

'After a few more hours of tests on inanimate objects, I wanted to see what would happen if you put a live subject through.'

'You went through?!' Jack asked anxiously.

'No, not then,' Louis answered. 'First I tested with some mice.'

'Mice?!' Carrie said, with a yucky face.

'Yup, mice.'

Not having a mice supply handy, Louis waited another three or four hours until some dusty suit, with sweat rivulets crossing his dusty face brought him a batch from Anderson. Anderson was a veterinarian, an old childhood friend of Louis’ and the best professional Louis knew. He thanked the man for his promptness, even if for Louis that took an eternity, and offered him a glass of precious water and a chair. The agent thanked him and said nothing for the time Louis continued his experiments.

He opened the box, which had 'Last Pets ™' stamped on it, Anderson’s idea of a name, and reached for the first white mouse. Grabbing it by the tail, Louis ushered it in front of the first Ring. The wiseguy didn't consider this to be a treatment meant for it and skittered off the robotic skeleton, under the tables and off it went, into some unknown crack in the wall.

Louis came back to the mice box just in time. So impatient and excited he was that he forgot to close the lid. The remaining mice wanted to flee their cardboard prison, as if sensing something's about to happen.

Louis grabbed the second mouse by its scruff and closed the lid of the box. He put a plastic pipe in front of the Ring and shoved the mouse in. He saw the small rodent going in through the Ring and hurried on to the other side of the second Ring to catch him.

His haste was proven unnecessary. The mouse stumbled a few paces, as if drunk and drowsy, then fell dead on its side.

'What happened, Louis?' Carrie cried, suddenly sympathetic of the unfortunate animal.

'Well...'

What had happened was, at that time, a mystery to Louis, so he went back and grabbed another mouse. This time he threw the mouse through the first Ring and ran past the second Ring to see what happened. The unfortunate creature didn't even move, this time.

Louis repeated the gig again. Same thing. Then he got a fourth mouse and slowly put its head through the first Ring, wanting to see what would happen. Just as it happened with the pencil, Louis marveled at the sight. Half of the mouse was through the first Ring and the other half, the one with the snout, was on the other one. He then saw the spine, with its vertebrae, the tissues and the tides of blood flowing through the vessels. Its heart pumped the blood wildly for a few seconds, reflecting probably the state of fear and disorientation the mouse must have felt, until a few seconds later, when it slowed, slowed, stopped.

Hurrying on the other side of the second Ring, Louis pulled the mouse, frustrated and feeling a little sorry for his victims.

'Come here,' he shouted to the agent, who was mesmerized by this freakshow. 'Hold this,' Louis instructed the agent, handing him the fifth mouse. 'Put him through this ring, as you saw me do it earlier and keep him there.'

When the fifth testmouse went in, Louis was waiting for the first half of it to come out of the second Ring. What he saw puzzled him even more.

'When you put them in, they squirm and want to escape, but when they come through...'

They looked blasé, catatonic. He snapped his fingers next to the mouse's ear and nothing. No reaction. No fretting whiskers. Its dead, staring eyes bared an enamel coat and soon after it emerged, it also died.

'What's in there?' Louis then asked, loudly and frustrated, the five hundred square feet laboratory.

What could've happened between the two Rings that made the mice die at arrival? What caused their hearts to fail and their brains to shut down?

Frustrated, not thinking, Louis grabbed a sixth mouse and shoved it unceremoniously, ass first, through the Ring. This time, the creature seemed to resume its panicky activity for almost a couple of minutes, until it also failed.

'What was it?' Carrie asked, frightened, this time.

Just as Carrie asked her question, Louis was parking. They were home. Not the home under Brightwood, California, but the one in old Chelsea, further down Central Park Avenue.

'Let's take a bath and I'll tell you over dinner, okay? It’s not something to be scared of, anyway. I took the Leap countless times and Ellie did the same. You saw your dad coming and going through the Ring, as well' Louis said.

'But I wanna know what happened to the mice!' Carrie protested.

A few hours later, the Cage family had packed all that was required for the two seconds travel, in the following day.

Both kids ate a frugal dinner that night, the hot bath having made them impossibly sleepy. Carrie, although she was almost out, didn't forget Louis' promise. She nagged him about not finishing the story, as him and Ellie put her and her brother to bed. At the sound of his sister, Jack started as well.

'Yeah, what happened? We wanna know!'

'Don't worry, kiddo,' Ellie told him, tucking him in. We'll have plenty of time tomorrow. She then kissed both kids good night.

Next day, they reached the Leap Lounge. The Leap Lounge was reserved only for the highest ranks, the president, vice-president and all the other important members of the state, army and navy. And of course, for its maker, Louis Cage and his family.

Not majestic was the word that would've best described the compound, even if awe was inspired to the untrained eye. Rather 'imposing' was the one.

After 2075, when the greenhouse effects started to take place, most of the world got a glimpse of what was to come in less than thirty years. Floods, violent storms and random arsons from the angry mobs swarming the streets, all those swiped what was New York. There, in downtown, where Washington Square used to be, under a fake monument erected in the memory of those that died in those adversities, the Leap Lounge awaited.

The kids seemed to have forgotten the where, what and how questions, as they made their way in, Ellie and Louis flanking them. They just stared at the triple top secret location of the Ring that was meant to send them on Kepler.

They went through the huge front door and then through the red carpeted corridor, a long long one, even by a grownup's standards and reached the white marbled hall, containing the passengers' seats and the first Leap Ring.

'Wow! Is that gold, Louis?' Jack asked, looking at it.

'Not really, but it has a nice touch,' he answered, watching the Ring and its imposing stature, perhaps twenty times bigger than the prototypes with which he had fought all those past years; a strange kind of beauty, cold and austere.

This is the sum of our hopes and our fears, he thought.

They approached a gate which resembled those airport gates where the staff scanned you. Only that this time the staff was waiting on the other side of the gate. The gate's main purpose was to detect if the passenger that went through it presented elevated levels of adrenaline.

They went through the gate and sit down, waiting for the staff. Next to them were another three leapers, waiting for the Ring to be activated. Louis glanced at the timer above the Ring. They had ten more minutes. The staff approached and greeted them, offering water and warm smiles, pushing a stainless steel cart, from which they drew out pen-like utensils.

Only they weren’t pens at all, Jack saw. The other three leapers took one, each. They strapped themselves with a seat-belt, put the utensil to their mouths and inhaled. A few seconds later they would succumb to a deep sleep and the staff would catch the inhalers, put the leapers in a comfortable position and prepared them for the Leap.

'Will you tell me now what happened to the mice, Louis?' Carrie asked, suddenly remembering her grandpa's debt and a little scared by the sight of the sleepy persons not far from them.

'Alright, alright,' Louis said, with a feinted exasperated sigh.

After the mice failed the leap, Louis wandered puzzled across the lab for a few minutes. The agent stood there with sand and sweat glued to his skin, watching and waiting until Louis came to him with a paper bag. He looked inside the bag and saw the mice.

'Take this to Anderson' he told the agent.

After a few days, Anderson sent the results, through the same agent, whom Louis kept as his errand boy from then on. The mice were perfectly alright, except for the fact that they were dead. No malfunctioning of the brain or of the heart was detected.

‘I don’t get it,’ Carrie said disgruntled.

Louis pointed at the three sleeping beauties. Jake followed the motion of his arm. ‘Remember the breathing masks from yesterday?’ Louis asked.

Jack lightened up. ‘That’s why the last mouse didn’t die so quickly?’ he asked, a funny expression dawning on his face, one Louis did not know what to make of.

‘Yup, you’re right on the money, kid,’ Louis congratulated him.

‘I still don’t get it,’ Carrie cried out.

‘You can’t take the Leap awake, sweetie,’ Ellie told her.

‘Well, why not?’ was Carrie’s immediate question.

‘You see,’ Louis took it over from his wife, ‘the Leap lasts less than a second. From the moment you go in, ‘til the moment you go out, it’s almost instantaneously for the body. But somehow, the mind doesn’t dance to the same tune.’

Louis knew it better than anyone. Not because he’d done experiments on himself. No, no, quite the opposite.

He and Anderson first got to the conclusion that one must go through fully asleep, after a few months of failed testing on animals.

One night, when they were both exhausted, Louis grabbed a fishbowl, which he got as a present from his wife, and threw it in frustration. The first Ring swallowed the fishbowl and the second one spat it out.

Just as Archimedes cried out, so did Louis, when he discovered that the fish were actually sleeping behind their tiny reef. That's why they didn't float with their bellies upwards.

‘After that, the human subjects followed and they came out alright,’ Louis concluded.

Except they weren’t your average Joes that got through. They were convicts, beggars and expendables. This wasn’t Louis’ idea, but the government’s. They wanted a working, usable human Leap and they wanted it fast.

All the subjects got through alright, Louis hadn’t lied about that. All the subjects that were officially hand-picked by the government, that is, except one. The agent who brought Louis the mice.

It turned out that the man developed a crush for Ellie. Even if she was almost fifty years old, Ellie was still a beautiful woman. So it happened that all this time, when the Cage couple worked on the Leap, the said agent, whose name Louis eventually forgot, started to grow jealous of Ellie’s husband.

It went like this for a few years, until Louis noticed the way the man was looking at him. The smoldering hatred had come to surface one evening, when the agent almost killed him, hadn’t it been for his wife.

The payback that Louis gave him, after the man woke up from the knocking blow that Ellie gave him, was a free ticket through the Ring.

‘You see,’ Louis told the man tied up to his chair, with a voice that promised no happy ending: ‘I haven’t actually thanked you for all this time you served me. I think you deserve to see, after all, what became of your work.’ He then pulled the man’s shirt up and stuck a needle in his arm.

‘In case you’re wondering, what I’m pumping you with is a lovely cocktail of Epinephrine.’

The sentence was clear enough. Take the Leap wide awake and loaded with adrenaline rush.

‘Have fun, kiddo!’ Louis cheered him goodbye.

Two seconds later, the man emerged from the second Ring. Nothing was changed about him, except the white mane of hair and his crazy eyes. He manage to utter ‘forever trapped,’ before he suffered by, what was later diagnosed by Anderson the veterinarian, a stroke.

Louis never mentioned this to anyone else and it was the secret of three persons. His, Ellie’s and Anderson’s.

‘You see,’ Louis told Carrie, ‘your mind can be your best friend. It can keep you entertained when you’re bored and can offer you great rewards if you train it, in whatever field you see fit. But if you let it on its own for too long, funny things can happen, peculiar, unexplainable to anyone.’

‘But is it safe to take the Leap?’ Carrie asked.

Louis and Ellie started laughing. ‘Of course it is, sweetheart. Look, I’ll even go first, so you can see that it’s ok.’

He beckoned one man to give him the inhaler and just as he put the thing into his mouth and drew the substance in, he saw Jack’s hungry eyes watching him.

He woke up on the other side, a brilliant dawn caressing his cheekbones. Still drowsy, he didn’t understand what happened, why he heard noise at first and then shouts. Finally, he got to the source of it and saw Ellie screaming and writhing in despair, pointing wildly and then suddenly collapsing to the floor.

Louis ran to Ellie’s aid and wanted to lift her up from the floor, when he saw what she was actually pointing at. The staff stared in disbelief at the thing that stood at the mouth of the second Ring.

It was Jack.

Jack, who was the first to take any dare and prove the world they’re wrong. Jack, who sought the adrenaline rush in everything he’d done. Jack and fear were never introduced.

Louis should have known, back on Earth. It wasn’t puzzlement that filled his grandson’s stare. It was excitement.

Now, instead of his grandson, there stood a creature older than time itself, with a white mane of hair and yellow, cataractous eyes bulging from its eye sockets, masquerading as a boy. Claws instead of hands now dangled on its sides, tearing at the seatbelt and its clothes, scaring the living daylights out of everyone around him. The old young legs wanted to stand but couldn’t and suddenly a shrill guttural laugh came out from its lips.

‘I saw, Louis! I saw! Held my breath when they came my way! Forever Leap! I saw, I saw!’

Louis then remembered the agent. The memory of sentencing that man to an eternity of mental pain, hit him in full. A great great bubble formed in his chest, begging to get out.

The mad laughter of his grandson was interrupted by the sudden realization that it was no longer alone and gouged its eyes out with its clawlike hands.

How long had the mind wandered in that endlessness? How long had it spent in there, between the two seconds it took for the body to be pushed from one side and emerge on to the other one? How many years for the mind to cannibalize on itself? Hundreds? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands?

Louis never got to answer his own question, because by the time his grandson died he was screaming himself.
