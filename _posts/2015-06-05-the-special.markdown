<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">R</span>iordan Rhodes, a man in his mid fifties, was feeling rather hungry in that late afternoon. Running such a big company left him famished, almost every Wednesday.</p>

“Tell me, Jenkins, are you booked for this evening?” he asked the man who shared his office and managed most of his affairs. A successful man, considering he was only thirty-two years of age.

“Why do you ask?”

“I’d like to take you out for dinner,” Rhodes replied, knowing that a bond needed to be established, given what he had in mind later that month.

Jenkins eyed him incredulously.

“What, what is it?” Rhodes asked. “Did I say anything strange?”

“No, sir, on the contrary! It’s just that – “ Jenkins paused for a moment. “I’ve known you for six years and it’s the first time you’ve invited me anywhere.”

“If you have other engagements, then…”

“No, I don’t. I’m almost finished for the day, so why not?”

“Excellent!” Rhodes said, with a smile of which a white shark would have been proud.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They took a cab and drove for about ten minutes, until Rhodes signaled to stop.

“That’ll be here, cabbie. You may pull over here.”

Jenkins looked around puzzled; they got out in a deserted back-alley, poorly lit and smelling of ill deeds.

Rhodes studied his manager’s features for a moment and patted him on the back. “That was my first thought too, when I first stole into this street. See, it’s a ritual I’ve long since assumed as my own. Walking a bit to shake off the clinging thoughts of the day just spent. Come.”

Jenkins nodded with a half-assuring smile. “Quite a curious place for a restaurant worth visiting in the evening, I must admit.”

“Well, it’s just a ten minute walk. Helps clear the mind and loosen up the joints.”

They walked for a little while, until Rhodes pointed with his walking stick a shambled building, with an excuse for a door.

“Here we are, then. Go on, don’t be afraid, it’s not going to bite if you open it.”

Jenkins opened the door and a sweet, funny smell welcomed him. It was the smell of cooking steam and dampness. He turned around and smiled at Rhodes a little more confident this time. “After you, then.”

Rhodes smiled back and went ahead.

As they made their way through the generous corridor, lit by various pockets of evening light watching from a patched ceiling, Rhodes spoke to Jenkins in a low voice.

“This place has no pretention, whatsoever; it’s lit by gas lamps from days long past and the insides of this antique beast, as you’ll shortly notice, are of the same opinion.”

Jenkins felt less uneasy when they were greeted by another human being. He felt as if they had traversed a damp and lightly intoxicating cocoon of partial darkness.

“Good evening mister Rhodes,” a strange, low and melodic voice welcomed them. It sounded as a saner version of Stoker’s Renfield, right before he returned to London.

“Good evening to you too, Marcus,” Rhodes replied. “I’m with a guest tonight. Is the alcove free, then?”

“Of course, sir,” the impersonating Renfield replied, on a smooth and beckoning tone.

Entering a hall of modest sizes, they were guided by the hunched Marcus through an almost eerie scenery. Or so it was the way Jenkins perceived it.

There was no music, the gas lamps were hanging from a tall ceiling and there was a noise that made him feel as if intruding upon a strange ritual. A private number, from the local carnie, where only the staff attended.

Every man present there was lapping at his food. It was as if caveman fur was all that was missing from these strange cultists’ backs, slaying their prey with fork and knife and teeth and smacking, greedy lips.

“Would there be a special tonight, Marcus?” Rhodes asked, snapping Jenkins awake from his observations, as they were seated at their table.

“I’m so sorry, sir,” came the reply. “No special tonight. But should I bring your food now?”

Jenkins looked bemused at Rhodes. “You ordered in advance? I see no menus.”

Marcus hovered patiently, until Rhodes nodded his approval. As the strange waiter left, Jenkins was still waiting for a reply.

“See, this is a more special place. There are no menus. And no, I didn’t order in advance.”

“Then?”

“This is called Ranthos’s, Kian. Do you mind if we use our first names?”

“No, not at all,” Jenkins replied.

“Ranthos, the man running this small and, as you’ll soon discover, delicious business, has this idea. That at some point every man has the same taste. And preference in his food. But I see from your face that you consider this to be a little far-fetched, even a bit arrogant, maybe.”

“Well, I do believe that this is an unusual way of doing business, yes.”

Rhodes showed the same sharklike smile he did earlier, at the office. “I was under the same impression, the first time. I thought that in no way can a place with such an ancient look, classic furniture, renaissant cutlery, hanging gas lamps, all this stuff cannot be a reflection of the quality it has to offer.”

“I can understand your reasoning,” Jenkins said. “And still, do people come here just to eat? I mean, I’ve never seen men eating their meals in this… barbaric manner.”

“Do you see much else? Or, as a matter of fact, do you hear much else? People come at Ranthos’ with the sole intention to eat. You come here to entertain none other than yourself. There are some unwritten rules about this place, which I'm more than happy to explain, but I see that Marcus is bringing us our food.”

The plates lowered on the table, Rhodes prepared for a veritable feast.

“Enjoy, gentlemen,” Marcus cheered, in his sweet and slithering voice.

Jenkins took the first bite reluctantly, but soon the fork started to gain speed and the look on his face switched from one of forced feeding to that of fascinated bewilderment.

After the meal was done and the waiter cleared the table, Jenkins was bursting with questions. Rhodes raised his hand, like an understanding father.

“Now, now, I can only say this. The course we’ve just had is nothing compared to the specialty of the house. But unfortunately, in spite of my hopes of introducing you to Ranthos’ finest dish, this evening was not such one.”

Jenkins stared wide-eyed.

“You mean it’s something better than this?”

“Indeed. But you’ll have to come back some other evening for that.”

“Well, I believe I’ll even bring Anna, if that’ the case…”

“No, no. Sorry old chap, but I’m afraid that won’t do,” Rhodes stopped him.

“Well, why not?”

“The fact that we are allowed in here, talking and eating, is because you are my guest. Usually, chattering creates a buzz and you and I both know the kind of mess such a noise can create,” he said, with a half-amused note. “That’s the reason why there is this woman taboo, you see.”

“I can understand but I don’t see the strictness in all of that.”

“This is a concession made to new members and as such, that’s why I chose this table, under the alcove, so as to not disturb our fellow members.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The following days, Jenkins caught himself thinking about the unique and odd experience he’d had over at Ranthos’. He’d come to the conclusion that it was something like entering a trance, if anything. Even if he’d never experienced one. Anna, on the other hand, had confessed at some point a trance-like behaviour, in her yoga class.

Jenkins always thought that yoga was a mellow way of extortion, promising people a clear conscience and peace of mind, delivering something else entirely. He looked with a disapproving eye on his girlfriend’s habit. He thought it a magic trick. Like when you conceal a coin between your fingers and you daze the kid on whom you’re performing, when you show it back to him, miraculously extracted from behind his ear.

“Hello, Kian,” Rhodes greeted. “Care to join me for dinner?” he asked waiting coat in hand, while standing in the doorway.

“Ranthos’?”

“What else?”

Jenkins smiled broadly and just as he got his coat for leaving, he paused. “Just a moment. I’ll call Anna.”

“Very well. I’ll be waiting in the cab, then. Don’t take your time, though. I feel ravenous this evening.”

Jenkins pulled out his phone and punched Anna’s number.

“Anna? Hello, dear. I’ll be coming a little late this evening. What? We’ve booked it two weeks ago? Well, could we schedule it for some other time, I have to go with Riordan. Well, of course it has to do with work. Look, Anna, I’m terribly sorry, I’m sure we can… Hello? Anna?”

Jenkins ended his conversation, as well as his relationship, he’d find out when he got home, with a sigh.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They reached Ranthos’ and as established by now, the waiter Marcus saw them to their seats.

“Is Anna upset for these escapades?” Rhodes began.

“I don’t think she’s very mush delighted, I tell you that. We’ve booked tickets for the opera since two weeks ago.”

Rhodes grunted what must’ve been an understanding, if not sympathetic grunt. Not very much upset, though.

“I’m sorry to hear that.”

“Well, I suppose you should feel al little bit guilty for dragging me here all the time.”

Rhodes laughed. “You don’t need much dragging of late. This is, what, your third visit?”

“Something like that, yes,” Jenkins approved, concededly.

“I believe that by now you’ve grown accustomed to our dinners and as we wait for Marcus to serve us whatever Ranthos has prepared for us for tonight…”

“Still no special, then?”

“Still no, I’m afraid. But nonetheless, let’s enjoy this meal.”

Jenkins nodded, disappointed. “I wonder, though, why hasn’t this place got more customers?”

“Ranthos’ customers are all here, Kian. No need to ask silly questions.”

Jenkins eyed him in disbelief.

“The men who know or need to know, for the moment, about Ranthos are all that you see here. And now, with your third visit, you’re one of them.”

“Unbelievable. But why?”

“You see, Ranthos wants his business private. He’s happy with these few customers,” Rhodes gestured toards the dinning room, with a sweeping arm. “As you’ve seen by now, people never talk at Ranthos’. And even less outside. Well, except you and I. By saying this, I trust I’ve made myself understood, on this particular regard.”

“Are you serious about this?”

“I’ve never been more serious, Kian. Especially in this evening, we shall celebrate you establishing visit at Ranthos’. You’ve now become a full patron yourself.”

Jenkins lightened up a bit. Sufficiently to ask Rhodes “How long have you been a patron, then?”

“Ten years,” Rhodes beamed at him. “And in these ten years I can say I’ve never eaten as good a dish as I have here, anywhere in the world. You can say that all these years I’ve had a love affair with food. I have no regret of abandoning the old restaurants I used to visit, except one.”

“What’s that?” Jenkins asked, curious.

“I’ve never visited Ranthos’ kitchen. I know it’s a fobidden place for customers, but I thought, since I’m such an established patron of this place, why not? It has become a rather obsessive fascination, going in there. To see the way the chefs prepare the meals.”

“I can agree with that, given with what food we are presented each evening. And was it a referral, in your case, as it was in mine, the way you came by Ranthos’?”

“Yes. All new members are exclusively brought in by existing ones. I was acquainted with Ranthos through a friend of mine, like I said, ten years ago.”

“Nice. And is your friend amongst us now?” Jenkins asked, turning in his chair, hoping he could spot his grandfather of sorts.

“No, sad to say, no. I never quite understod why not. He said he’d go on a business trip to China, to close some fabulous deal, but I don’t think I ever saw him since.”

“Peculiar,” Jankins said.

“I thought so too.”

“Here you are, sirs,” Marcus concluded the excited pair of gourmands. “I hope you’ll enjoy, as you always do. Bon appetit, gentlemen!”

They bit into the damp, yielding flesh. Slowly. And thoughtfully. As if analyzing the intricacies of a piece of music. The range of taste was extraordinary. From the pungent nip of the crispy outer-edge, to the deeply satisfying ooze of blood. The pressure of their jaws forced the half-raw interior.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“Well, was I telling the truth about this place,” Rhodes asked, mouth still full, “or was I not?”

“How do they do it?”

“Well, this is only part of Ranthos’ excellence, remember.”

“Right, we have yet to experience the... special menu.”

“Right you are! What you’ve eaten until now is nothing compared to that.”

“I somehow find that hard to believe. What’s it going to be? A rare bird from across the world, with exotic fruits on the side?”

“The rarest sheep in existence. Lamb Ameorstan.”

“Can’t say I’ve ever heard of it.”

“Desolate little spot, where it grows. On the border between Russia and Mongolia.”

“But Ranthos surely could let us know when he receives such an order.”

“Ranthos feels that this dish, most prized of all, must be kept as a surprise for its patrons. It’s a sort of ritual with him and the lamb Ameorstan. And besides, you are not yet at the beckoning call of you palate, Kian.”

Jenkins broke into a hearty laugh, uncaring of the rules handed down to him, as a fresh “patron” of the place. Somehow, all this seemed like a bad joke, in a noire film. The secrecy, the ritual, the silence.

“I must admit, Riordan. You are quite a figure.”

Rhodes smiled rather forcefully, the way a constipated hyena would at a prancing flamingo. He ushered the moment by raising from the table.

“Come with me, Kian. Let’s enjoy this finished meal in a more relaxed environment.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A few minutes later, the two men were talking in a local bathhouse.

“Quite unexpected, this place. I had no idea these still exist,” Jenkins said.

“Well, not many folk know about the existence of it.”

“Seems like a rule around here, the secrecy and such.”

Rhodes rose from his place and gestured for Jenkins to get closer.

“You see, this is more of a classic bathhouse. The water runs over preheated stones and minerals.”

Jenkins nodded impressed. “You never fail to surprise me. Which brings me to it. What’s the purpose of this whole impressing act, Riordan?” A shuffling of feet sounded right above them.

Rhodes looked at him casually, but lowered his voice and gestured for Jenkins to do the same. “What do you mean?”

“You know. It’s six years since you’ve had me as your employee and all of a sudden this courtship-like behaviour pops out of nowhere. Surely you have something in mind. I know not what, but surely something of importance. If not to me, then to you at least.”

Rhodes was contemplating the walls. “I usually come here after a delicious, a particularly delicious meal. Sometimes even before dinner. To escape from the insanity of the day. It helps me loosen up my muscles and relax. Tenders those nasty stress-knots.”

He seemed to be struggling with words, almost on the brink of giving up.

“I’ve brought you here at Ranthos’ for two reasons. One is to share the exquisite experience that Ranthos has been to me for the past ten years.”

“You mean to say that in all this time you’ve told no-one about Ranthos?”

The shuffling feet sounded again.

“Believe it or not. Gues I took my time.”

“What for?”

“Finding someone worthy enough. It may sound foolish to you, but it’s not,” Rhodes answered dignified.

“And what is the other reason?”

“I’m going on a long vacation. I wanted to get to know you a little better.”

Jenkins looked inquisitive. “And…?”

“I’ll be leaving the company in capable hands. Yours among them. You’ll find tomorrow that your office has become a lot bigger, now that I won’t be visiting as often until I leave.”

Jenkins looked dumbstruck. “Riordan… I’m at a loss here. Don’t know what to say!”

“Nothing, would be the most accurate answer. I don’t want anyone besides you and my attorney to know that I’ll be absenting for a while.”

“Why? When are you leaving?”

“Anytime I like. It’s Ranthos’, you see. I still wait for that damned special to show up, so I can leave at peace.”

Both men were interrupted by an approaching man.

“Good evening, gentlemen! I trust you are enjoying yourselves?” It was Marcus, with his slithery walk and talk. Something bugged Jenkins about him, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.

“Yes we do, Marcus. Thank you,” Rhodes replied annoyed. “That’ll be all.”

The waiter smiled and retreated with a “have a nice evening, gentlemen!”

Rhodes and Jenkins exchanged looks, then they both shrugged, thinking that Marcus must have a dull life if eavesdropping was this exciting to him.

“Well, that’s that, then,” Rhodes concluded.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The following week Rhodes was surprised to get a call from Jenkins, inviting him to dinner.

“I was just preparing for my departure. I think this will be our last dinner together, in a long while. I assume you want to thank me for clearing out my desk and leaving you in charge, as the new stick-bearer?” Rhodes asked, with a light laugh, as they were seated.

Jenkins shook his head. “It’s Anna. Since she left I feel a perpetual disappointment. I was looking forward to sharing the news of my new promotion.”

“It is unfortunate.”

“Yes, I suppose so. She got suspicious ever since…”

“You’ve started coming to Ranthos’,” Rhodes finished his thought. “I know.”

“If only I can convince her of how hard it is to stay away from this place. I mean, she’s a great cook…”

“But nothing compared to this,” Rhodes closed, nodding understandingly, like a modern day sage, tight tie-knot and all.

Rhodes looked around, taking the place in and memorizing every detail.

“I’ll miss this place, to be frank. In all these years, it has been my go-to retreat. Here I’ve always found the respite I needed.”

“I’ll miss our chats over dinner,” Jenkins said, moved.

“Kind of you to say so, Kian.” Rhodes looked upon the hall one last time, finding that Johnson, another regular patron, as he so lavishly liked to call Ranthos’ customers, was missing that evening.

Marcus showed up, almost dancing his way at their table, excited and grinning, like a Halloween pupmpkin.

“Sirs, tonight we have a surprise for you!”

Rhodes’ eyes widened in utter astonishment.

“Do you mean…?”

“Special night, tonight, sir!” Marcus approved.

“Did you hear that, Kian?”

Jenkins wasn’t any way less surprised than his food companion was. “Lamb Ameorstan? Finally?”

“Hurry up, Marcus, don’t just stand there,” Rhodes ordered, “you’ll have two raving-mad customers if you delay us any second longer.”

“Of course, sirs!”

Marcus retreated to the kitchen and in his stead a large, burly man arrived at the two animated gentlemen’s table, carrying a large plateau.

“Good evening, gentlemen,” he greeted them. “No, no, no need to stand up,” he said as he filled the empty table with the wonderfully smelling dish.

“Kian, this is Ranthos,” Rhodes declared in a proud and solemn tone.

“Finally I meet the man himself!”

“Delighted as well, mister Jenkins. I trust you’ve decided to become a regular customer, no? A patron, as mister Rhodes so elegantly likes to say.”

“There wasn’t any other choice on the plate, once I’ve finished my first meal here,” Jenkins approved with a laugh.

Ranthos nodded, a satisfied grin adorning his face. “Then you’ll appreciate even more the lamb Ameorstan.”

Rhodes was eyeing the plateau with ravenous delight.

“I see that our esteemed mister Rhodes is dying to have a taste. Please, mister Jankins, allow me.”

He cut a sliver from the beautifully prepared meat, a trickle of pinkish blood making its way down the knife, once Ranthos served Jenkins his first bite.

“Absolute honesty, sir!”

Jenkins took a bite and chewed it slowly, closing his eyes and savoring every second of the special lamb. His left foot started to bounce, as he leapt to grab the fork and knife for seconds.

“My God! I can’t even describe it! This is the best thing I’ve eaten since… sinces… Ever!”

Rhodes and Ranthos exchanged a proud look.

“I always say, mister Jenkins, that every time someone new tries my specialty of lamb Ameorstan, the first bite he takes is like taking a glimpse into his own soul. An experience few know about its meaning and even fewer seem to appreciate it. Completely.”

Rhodes cut himself the first portion and cautioned his companion. “As the man said. Savor every morsel, my friend. You don’t know when you’ll eat such a wonderful course next.”

“You flatter me, sir,” Ranthos said. “Before I go, I must give you a great news, mister Rhodes. I am sorry that I cannot extend the same courtesy towards mister Jenkins, but Marcus has told me of your immediate departure and knowing your longtime wish, I was able to persuade the chefs to allow one of our most esteemed customers to step into our kitchen.”

Rhodes stared bewildered both at Jenkins and at Ranthos.

“Are you serious, Ranthos?”

“Never been more serious than now, sir. One of our chefs threatened to give notice on the spot, but I was able to make him see reason. Given your special status, of course. Will you be accepting my invitation, then, mister Rhodes?”

“Of course! That's the best dessert I’ve ever had, Ranthos. Thank you. And thank your staff, as well, for allowing me such courtesy.”

“Nothing at all. Gentlemen, I shall leave you now with your dinner. Enjoy!”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After the table was cleared and both men were sighing, bellies full of the specialty of the house, Jenkins lauded the chef and his dinner.

“This is the best thing I’ve ever eaten. Is it always like this? The taste, I mean.”

“Well, sometimes it’s sweeter, other times a bit more acidic,” Rhodes schooled his manager. “I believe it depends on how old the lamb was. But nonetheless, it’s a good reason to slave over our meat, like prehistoric barbarians, don’t you agree?”

Jenkins’ phone vibrated in his pocket. He got it out, read the message on its screen and lightened up in an instant.

“Good news, I take it?” Rhodes asked.

Jenkins almost jumped from his seat. “Anna wants to meet me. She says she’s sorry for overreacting!”

"Perfect timing, then! I’m glad for you, Kian. This is a perfect night for the both of us.”

“I couldn’t agree more, Riordan.” Jenkins stepped in and hugged Rhodes. “Thank you for introducing me to Ranthos’. It’s the best place to eat, as you said. I’m sorry we won’t dine together for a while.”

Rhodes hugged him back and thanked him.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After Jenkins’ departure, Ranthos came and collected Riordan Rhodes, to show him the place he fervently wanted to see, for the past ten years. The large man stood besides Rhodes. Patient. He was the tour-guide on the most anticipated trip of Rhodess' life.

Rhodes stepped through the open doors of the kitchen as if through a portal. He didn’t know what he expected to find, but the ecstasy of ten years’ yearning and waiting vanished with each step that he took, after that threshold.

“It’ so… clean!” he said, disappointed.

“Yes, it is, isn’t it, mister Rhodes?” Ranthos said, calm and joyful. “That’s how it’s supposed to be, after the meat is cut and prepared. Check out the slab, mister Rhodes. One of the finest you’ll ever find. Made out of Italian marble! Over three generations old. Belonged to my father, grandfather and great-grandfather.”

Rhodes didn’t know how to react. He was expecting chefs to be working, food to be prepared, scents and dizzying aromas to fill the air. But all he ever saw was a clean, spotless, sterile place.

“Check the knives, mister Rhodes. They’re as sharp as you’ll ever find anywhere else.”

“Yes. Alright. Everything’s… all nice.”

The man called Ranthos stopped and studied Rhodes for a short moment.

“Come and see where we prepare your wonderful dish, sir.” He guided Rhodes into a large room.

Rhodes analyzed the empty room, with its huge electric bulb peering from above, emitting its cold light. He saw four walls and a great big floor. Mute, white and empty walls and a cold, wet, grated floor.

He heard a short loud “clack!”. When he turned around, he saw Ranthos. Smiling, behind the glass doors of the slaughter chamber. Calmly and thankfully.

“You’ve been a faithful customer, mister Rhodes. One of our most esteemed patrons, as you yourself like to call it. For that, sir, you have my deepest appreciation.”

A slight panic started to rise. And rise. And rise. Each wave crushing in on him.

“What is this, Ranthos?” he asked, not wanting an answer. Because he knew it. Instantly. Intimately. Surely.

This was Ameorstan.

“Don’t worry, mister Rhodes. We’ll be careful with our patron. We always are.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Half an hour later nobody heard the screams bouncing off those mute, white, empty walls. Ranthos told the truth. They were careful, alright.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Jenkins waited anxiously, until the dish was served. It was a marvelous evening. It was a special evening. As he thanked Marcus for his service, now used to the man’s peculiar manners, Ranthos came at his table.

“Did you enjoy our special, mister Jenkins?”

“It was superb!” Jenkins hailed. “Don’t remember having anything as good as this.”

“Thank you. You are making your host pleased. At times, the meat is more… tender and relaxed from those nasty stress-knots, you see. Such was the case with this lamb.”

Jenkins smiled satisfied. “I have only to thank you for that, Ranthos! If only Riordan was here tonight. It’s his favorite, you know?”

Ranthos smiled a fiendish smile. “I’d like to think he is with us in spirit, sir.”

“Right! Well then, I'd best be on my way. I can only hope you’ll be serving your special lamb more often.”

“I’m glad to hear that! I cannot wait to serve you next time, mister Jenkins.”

“Good evening, then!” Jenkins said, as he headed towards the exit.

“Have a pleasant night, sir.”
